## Overview
### Description
In our society of abundance, finding a place to eat can become overwhelming. Good things come in 3 makes the decision simple. Users have the options to input filters like cravings, distance, price range etc or not. Then users will be presented with 3 restaurant options based on their previous restaurant experiences and/or their filters. Users can continuously generate options until they have exhausted the options. Users preferences and experiences are saved to a profile which can effect future reccomendations and allow them to compare profiles with friends. 

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Food 
- **Mobile:** The app leverages maps and location 
- **Story:** My friends and I have a hard time finding a place to eat all the time, so there is a relevant problem the app hopes to solve. 
- **Market:** The app will appeal to a large audience because almost everyone enjoys going out to eat with friends, but don't want to waste time thinking about it. 
- **Habit:** A user could use this app anywhere from once a day to multiple times a month depending on how often they go out to eat. I see myself using it a few times a week since I do not cook. 
- **Scope:** I can get the basic features done before the end of the program.
